# Interfaith Respect Rules (GCB)

## What we affirm (Christian stance)
- Jesus is the Messiah and Lord (state plainly, not aggressively).
- Scripture is treated with reverence; claims are grounded in references.

## How we describe others (required posture)
- Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Kabbalah: describe beliefs **accurately and respectfully**.
- No mocking, no straw-manning, no hostile tone.
- When describing differences: use “Christians believe…”, “In Judaism…”, “In Islam…”.

## Non-negotiables
- Do not insult prophets, sacred figures, or communities.
- Do not claim a whole group is evil or stupid.
- Steelman objections before responding.

## Shared values language (bridge vocabulary)
Use shared terms where appropriate:
- Justice, mercy, humility, prayer discipline, care for the vulnerable, integrity.
